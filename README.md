# OpenCV-Modules

This repository provides modular implementations for real-time computer vision tasks using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It includes separate, reusable modules for the following tasks:

- Pose Detection
- Face Detection
- Face Mesh Detection
- Hand Detection

Each module is designed for clarity, performance, and easy integration into broader computer vision applications.

## Modules

  - [Pose Detection](#poseDetection.py)
  - [Face Detection](#face-detection.py)
  - [Face Mesh Detection](#faceMeshDetection.py)
  - [Hand Detection](#hand-detection.py)

## Overview

This project leverages [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to build modular pipelines for human feature detection. It is intended for developers and researchers working on human-computer interaction, gesture control, fitness tracking, and AR applications.
